## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring allows you to unpack multiple properties from an object or an array and place them directly into a variable.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {property1, property2} = object;
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [x, y, z] = array;
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  A literal syntax would rely on dot notation or bracket notation to pull out the properties one at a time, whereas the destructuring syntax uses the braces (for object) or brackets (for arrays) and property names to pull out all properties at once.
