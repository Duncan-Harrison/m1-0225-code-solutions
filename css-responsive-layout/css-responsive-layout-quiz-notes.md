## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  A breakpoint is a point in the CSS code that resizes certain elements to fit within different screen sizes without having to code around every possible screen size.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  Using a percentage allows your elements to adjust and fit within any screen size without having to know the pixel-based size of those screens.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `width` _after_ the styles for a larger `width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `width` will "win". Why is that?
  The smaller width would win in this case because the source order feature of CSS gives the last code priority over the earlier code.
