## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a reusable block of code that performs an operation and, sometimes, returns a value.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function is initialized with the keyword 'function' and given a name to use to call it later. The parameters in the parentheses that serve as value placeholders when it is time to call the function, and the code block between the curly braces define the function when it is called.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function is called by typing its name and the parentheses that may hold the arguments to serve as the parameters of the called function.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call simply states the name of the function and the arguments used to produce new results. A function definition carefully constructs what operations would be performed by the function.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder value that allows the function to be defined. An argument is a value or object that replaces the parameter once a function is called.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful because they help specify how a function will work once called.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The return statement both produces a value we can use in our program and prevents any more code in the code block from being run.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  We create a variable with const that is assigned a value. The value is actually our arrow function. We start with parameters in the parenthetical, an arrow => that leads to the code block in the curly braces, and the actual code block in the curly braces. Alternatively, if having an implicit return, you can have the arrow point to a single line of code that serves as the code block. No curly braces or return statements would be necessary.
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  A concise body syntax means a function is now designed to perform very simple tasks that will not exceed one line of code. This syntax also guarantees a return value due to the implicit return.
