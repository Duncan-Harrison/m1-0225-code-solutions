## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What data type is returned by an arithmetic operation?
  Numbers are returned in arithmetic operations.
- What is string concatenation?
  String concatenation is the act of combining several separate strings into one string.
- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?
  The plus operator is used for both arithmetic functions to add numbers together and string concatenations.
- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?
  Comparing data values returns a booleand data type.
- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?
  The plus-equals operator adds the right operand to the left operand and then assigns the result to the left operand. So if X was assigned the value of 5, then x += 7 would cause X to now be assigned the value of 12.
