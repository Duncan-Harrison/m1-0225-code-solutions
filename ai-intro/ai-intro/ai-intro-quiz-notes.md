## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  My answer:
  AI will not replace software developers, but software developers who use AI will replace those who do not.
  AI Answer:
  AI will not fully replace software developers anytime soon. While AI tools are becoming more capable, they still have limitations when it comes to creativity, problem-solving in complex situations, and understanding the broader context of a software project. AI can automate repetitive tasks, assist with debugging, and even help write code, but human software developers are essential for:
  *Designing software architectures
  *Making decisions about trade-offs
  *Understanding user needs and business goals
  *Solving problems that require nuanced judgment or experience
  In the future, AI may act more as a powerful assistant to developers, rather than a replacement. It’s likely that the role of a developer will evolve, with AI handling certain tasks, but developers will still be needed for high-level thinking, design, and decision-making.
- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  My Answer:
  AI should be used for simple quality checks like coding syntax, explaining code snippet purposes or coding concepts, explaining errors, and quizzing you on your coding knowledge.
  AI Answer:
  AI tools can be incredibly helpful while learning software development. Here are some effective ways to use them:
  *Assistance with Syntax and Code Examples: Use AI tools to understand programming languages, syntax, or frameworks. When you’re stuck on a specific error or concept, AI can help provide clarity or examples to point you in the right direction.
  *Code Debugging and Suggestions: As a beginner, debugging can be challenging. AI-powered tools like code linters or IDE plugins can help identify common mistakes and suggest improvements.
  *Learning Concepts: Use AI tools to explain programming concepts in simpler terms. It can offer multiple perspectives or alternative explanations when a textbook or tutorial isn’t clear.
  *Practice with Projects: Once you get comfortable with basics, AI tools can help you generate starter code or assist you with project ideas. It can also suggest best practices for structuring your code or optimizing it for performance.
  \*Exploring Documentation: Many times, AI can summarize documentation or point out important parts of a tech stack, saving you time.
  By using AI in these ways, you can speed up your learning and gain a deeper understanding of various development concepts.
- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  My Answer:
  AI tools predict things rather than actually know them, and if it has no history with the subject, it will frequently predict incorrectly. Because AI tools are relatively new to coding, AI tools are especially incorrect in their predictions about coding solutions.
  AI Answer:
  The main danger when using AI tools during the learning phase is becoming overly reliant on them. Here are a few specific risks:
  *Superficial Learning: If you let AI handle too much, you may not fully understand the underlying concepts. It's tempting to let AI generate code for you, but doing so without understanding it means you won’t develop your problem-solving skills or a deeper grasp of the language and algorithms.
  *Missed Learning Opportunities: Debugging your own code and figuring out why something isn’t working is a crucial part of the learning process. If AI quickly solves your problems, you might miss out on valuable lessons.
  *Copy-pasting Code: It's easy to copy AI-generated code without fully understanding it. This can lead to you using inefficient or incorrect solutions without realizing why they’re suboptimal.
  *Lack of Debugging Skills: If AI tools are doing most of the debugging for you, you might not develop the ability to spot and fix bugs on your own, which is an essential skill for any developer.
  In short, AI can be a useful guide, but it should be used in conjunction with a proactive, hands-on approach to learning. Focus on building a solid foundation of knowledge before relying heavily on AI tools to complete your work.
