## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are arrays used for?
  Arrays are used to store multiple values within a single variable as a list. They are flexible enough to store items of any type. Arrays also impose an order on the stored values, which can be useful when the order of the data matters.
- Describe array literal notation.
  Array literal notation defines the array as a variable and then initializes the array with a list of comma-separated values inside a pair of brackets.
- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
  Arrays have several built-in methods that allow you to manipulate the stored data without building new functions. You can also perform operations on each item in an array because arrays can be easily iterated over.
- What number represents the first index of an array?
  0
- What is the `length` property of an array?
  Array.length stores the total number of items in the array.
- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
  You can calculate the last index of an array by subracting 1 from the length. example:
  let arrayLength = array.length;
  let array.last = array[arrayLength - 1]
