## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- When was TypeScript introduced?
  Typescript was introduced in October 2012.
- Who created TypeScript?
  Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft created Typescript.
- What does the TypeScript `Compiler` do?
  The compiler converts the Typescript code into a Javascript, a code that the computer can run. In doing so, it also checks the Typescript code for errors, refusing to convert and run the code until the errors are fixed.
- How can you compile TypeScript to JavaScript?
  You can open the TypeScript Compiler by typing npx tsc watch in the command terminal of your syntax editor. As long as you do not have any errors in your TypeScript, the compiler will compile your code to Javascript.
- What are some benefits of using TypeScript?
  As a strictly typed language, TypeScript prevents runtime errors by forcing the programmer to correct compile time errors. Also, by forcing the the programmer to explicitly define the types of data a variable can hold, TypeScript catches bugs and errors faster than Javascript. Lastly, by way of the previous advantages, Typescript more cleanly enables large-scale programming.
