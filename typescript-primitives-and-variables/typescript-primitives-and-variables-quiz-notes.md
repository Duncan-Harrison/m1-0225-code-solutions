## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables are the containers that store data values.
- How do you **declare** a variable?
  You declare variables with const, let, or var (although you should usually use const and let).
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  You use the equal sign to assign a value to the variable
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  You may name a variable with letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs. However, they cannot start with numbers.
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  If you name two separate variables the same thing, but the capitalization of that name changes between variables (such as tomcat and TomCat), those two variables will be treated as separate variables.
- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string stores text to be shown in a browser as actual words.
- What is the purpose of a number?
  A number represents both integer and floating-point values.
- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  A boolean value registers whether a variable is true or false.
- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  The equal sign operator assigns a value to a variable.
- How do you update the value of a variable?
  You can update the value of a variable by changing the assigned value after the equal sign operator.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Null is a value showing that a variable was intentionally left without a value assigned. Undefined shows a variable that was never initialized.
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Labels help you more cleanly examine your code for concerns
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  The five primitives of JavaScript are strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, and undefined.
