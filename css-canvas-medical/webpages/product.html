        <h1>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h1>
        <p>
          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
          clinicians, staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more
          productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your
          practice of medicine.

          You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce
          around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls
          everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to
          leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets
          smarter with every patient you see.

          &quot;Canvas works three times as fast improves performance
          dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use.
          The right information is presented in the right way at the right time,
          and the product leverages technology to actually improve the quality
          of care I provide.&quot;

          Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire

          it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with
          proactive interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step ahead.

          &quot;Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a test in
          the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe
          levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That
          doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important
          questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old system!

        <h2>It Automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
          performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
          revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
          capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

          &quot;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex
          as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up.
          We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group
          of coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely
          eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance.&quot;
