        <h1>Clinicians should have software they love.</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable,
          intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine &mdash; and
          improve their day-to-day.

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p class="offcenter">
        Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen
        dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and
        efficiency of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their
        computers. Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is
        left unstructured.
      </p>
      <p class="offcenter">
        We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their
        technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art and
        science &mdash; technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with
        clinicians across the country, we think we have begun to build something
        that helps.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p class="offcenter">
        Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna
        &mdash; a family nurse practitioner &mdash; sacrifice family time in the
        evenings to &quot;finish&quot; charting. It never ended.
      </p>
      <p class="offcenter">
        Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He started
        to fill the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing clinicians formed
        the clinical advisory board &mdash; rather than leave practice to work
        full-time with Canvas, they used and reviewed product changes in their
        practices. Our Medical Director, Dr. Zimmerman, joined when he saw the
        potential of Canvas to help independent practices like his practice,
        Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland, CA. Julian joined Canvas after
        working at Medicare and seeing the failures of current technology to
        keep up with increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians.
        Joe and a world class group of software developers joined to accelerate
        our ability to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve the
        product.
      </p>
      <p class="offcenter">
        With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that
        completely eliminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The name of the
        company describes the charting experience &mdash; it feels like a blank
        canvas shere you can tell the patient's story and seamlessly complete
        notes, orders, and chart review on a single, unified screen. With
        seamlessly integrated population health, billing, and practice
        management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern primary care
        practice.
