## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the syntax for writing a template literal?
  You write a template literal first by wrapping the entire value in backticks. Example: const templateString = `This is a string.`
- What is "string interpolation"?
  String interpolation is the process of substituting parts of a string with an embedded expression (a variable), so you can skip the addition operator to combing strings or do a bunch of other work to use numbers within a string.
