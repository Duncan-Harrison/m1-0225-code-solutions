## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
  The 'className' property allows us to access and manipulate the CSS classes applied to elements.
- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
  You can use the setter function of the className property to add a new name to the selected class.
- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
  The 'textContent' property allows us to access and manipulate the text content stored in the selected element.
- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  You use the textContent property's setter function to update the content stored in the selected element.
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  The event parameter is not always useful, as you can sometimes have multiple DOM Objects in a callback instead.
- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
  This assignment would be more complicated, as we would have to write more extensive code to update the click count without an appropriate variable.
- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
  It is better to store information in variables because it makes it faster and easier to access that information.
