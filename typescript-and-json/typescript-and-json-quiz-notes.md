## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSON?
  JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that more easily encodes and exchanges data than other C-family languages.
- What are serialization and deserialization?
  Serialization converts a data structure or object into a storable format (a string). Deserialization is the process of turning that string back into the original data.
- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
  Serialization with JSON allows data to be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed more easily, so it is useful for transferring code over a network or into a database. Deserialization lets you use that data within JavaScript for more complex purposes as needed.
- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using TypeScript?
  JSON.stringify
- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using TypeScript?
  JSON.parse
