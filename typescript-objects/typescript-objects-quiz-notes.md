## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  Objects are used to group related data and functions together in a reusable way.
- What are object properties?
  Properties are the individual variables and their assigned values that are stored within an object.
- Describe object literal notation.
  Object literal syntax declares the object like a variable and then adds the properties to the object between the curly braces.
- How do you remove a property from an object?
  You can use the delete operator to name and remove a specific property from an object.
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  You can use either dot notation or bracket notation to get the value of of an existing property, update that value of the called property, or to push a new property into the object.
- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces allow us to annotate objects, just as we would annotate the value types of independent variables.
- What are two different ways to describe the shape of an object in TypeScript?
  An object can be shaped with an Interface or with a Type.
- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Optional properties are different than mandatory properties in that they do not have to be present in an object for that object to run without error. They are useful in cases where some objects of the same interface have more properties than others.
