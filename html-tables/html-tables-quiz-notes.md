Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the six primary HTML elements for creating tables?
  Aside from the <table></table> tags to open and close the table, the six primary elements of a table are <tr> to define a row, <th> to define headers in the table, <td> to define a cell, <thead> to contain the header rows that define the columns of the table, <tbody> to wrap the content rows of the tables into one or more groups, and <tfoot> to create footer rows that summarize the table's data.

- What purpose do the `thead` and `tbody` elements serve?
  The <thead> element creates the rows that name the columns the other rows will feed data into, and the <tbody> element wraps the content rows into one or more groups.
