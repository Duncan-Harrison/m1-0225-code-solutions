## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  Greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal to >=, less than or equal to <=, exactly equals ===, loosely equals ==
- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  boolean
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  The 'if' statement creates the first boolean condition that allows a conditional to run
- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  The 'else' statement creates the final boolean condition that stops a conditional from running forever
- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  The if statement begins with the if keyword. We then have the boolean expression within the parentheses that will run the if conditional. The code block within the curly braces then describes what the if conditional will do when the boolean expression is met.
- What are the three logical operators?
  Logical and &&, logical or ||, and logical not !
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  You write the two boolean expressions within the same parentheses and establish a logical operator to compare them.
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  The switch statement is essentially a faster way to create multiple else/if statements that need to be run and compared against each other.
- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  A default clause is optional but very useful.
