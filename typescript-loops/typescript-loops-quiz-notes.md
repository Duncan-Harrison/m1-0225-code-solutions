## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  A loop allows you to run the same block of code multiple times without having to write a lot of code. Loops are also critical for working with arrays, objects, and other data collections.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The condition allows the loop to start and continue running so long as that condition is true.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  "Iteration" refers to the number of times the loop has been run.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initial expression is evaluated once before the loop begins to iterate.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression is evaluated after each iteration, before the next one starts.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break;
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The `++` increment causes the initial expression or variable being run through any loop to increase by one (assuming it is a number value type); which could help terminate the loop.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You use a for in loop to iterate through each key in an object.
